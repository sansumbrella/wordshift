/**
A basic renderer for grouping rendered content and rendering in order.
Pre- and post- draw hooks let you set up the proper render context.

Renders anything with a render() method (overridden from IRenderable)

IRenderable objects' destructors remove them from the renderer, which keeps a
non-owning raw pointer to renderables, allowing you to manage the object's
lifetime as you see fit. Symmetrically, the renderer will disown any renderables
when it is destructed.

The copy-constructor and copy-assignment operators are designed to preserve the
expected behavior in case you have a std::vector of renderables.
