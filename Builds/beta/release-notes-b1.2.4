Graphics are feature-complete
Animating the things I want to animate
Iconified various elements
Multiple levels of feedback
Updated main menu ordering (strategy first; less pressure)

Multiplayer modes are revamped:
Speed mode and Strategy mode
Speed mode is really frantic, lasts 2 minutes per player
Strategy mode is pretty relaxed, games took 10â€”15 minutes for two players
House Rules added, tap the 'end turn' button to end your turn. Game lasts until you end it.

Singleplayer modes have an adjusted bonus time/swap curve:
More time/moves for the longest words
Should be more satisfying for advanced players, as play limit approaches the ability to think of new words.

Bug fixes (end of game frantic tapping sometimes caused a crash before)
